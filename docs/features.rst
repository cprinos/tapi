Features
========

1. Test you API without writing any code (only edit a json file)
2. Test you APIs in a much more 'natural' way by specifying urls/verbs and what the output should be
3. Verify anything from response status codes, headers, body content etc
4. Also allows verification by issuing another API call to a different endpoint to ensure a prior API call worked
5. Tests your APIs using your own APIs
